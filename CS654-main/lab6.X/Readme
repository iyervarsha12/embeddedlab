In this lab we used ADC on the dsPIC33F board to capture and display the position of
the ball on the touchscreen for both the X and Y dimensions. The program does the following:
1. Move both the servos to their minimum position (-90â—¦ angle). This will place the ball in one
corner, say corner 1. Once you set the servo angle, add a delay of 2 seconds to allow the ball
to settle in the corner. 
2. Read and store five 12-bit samples of the current X position of the ball. 
3. Read and store five 12-bit samples of the current Y position of the ball. 
4. Compute the sample that represents the median (not average) digital value of the X position
of the ball over the five samples that were collected at step 1. 
5. Compute the sample that represents the median (not average) digital value of the Y position
of the ball over the five samples that were collected at step 2. 
6. Print the median values for both the X and Y position of the ball to the LCD in a separate
line.
7. Repeat steps 1 to 6 indefinitely, every time but at every iteration of the loop, change the
corner in which the ball is positioned, looping through all the corners. Each time, update the
LCD such that the current position of the ball on the touchscreen is displayed in real-time
