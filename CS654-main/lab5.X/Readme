In this lab we used pulse width modulation to control the servo motors on the dsPIC33F
board. The lab does the following:
1. Display a prompt on the LCD for specifying the joystick’s maximum value in the x-dimension.
You must also display the current digital value of the joystick’s x-position as it updates in real
time. When the joystick’s trigger button is pressed, keep the digital value of the joystick’s
x-position at the time of the trigger press displayed on the LCD and stop further updates
to this value. You must use debouncing to determine when the joystick’s trigger button is
pressed. 
2. Same as (1) but instead for the minimum in the x-dimension. 
3. Same as (1) but instead for the maximum in the y-dimension. 
4. Same as (1) but instead for the minimum in the y-dimension. 
5. Display a prompt on the LCD for specifying the servo motor pulse width in the x-dimension
in microseconds. The joystick’s current x-position must determine the current pulse width
in the x-dimension as it updates in real time, such that it is possible to set the plate at a
proportional angle on the x-dimension by moving the joystick to the corresponding x-position.
When the joystick trigger button is pressed, keep the x-dimension pulse width at the time of
the trigger press displayed on the screen and stop further updates to both the LCD as well
as to the servo motors. You must use debouncing to determine when the joystick’s trigger
button is pressed. 
6. Same as (5) but instead for the servo motor y-dimension and the joystick’s current y-position
