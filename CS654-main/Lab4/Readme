In this lab we used timers and real-time signal handlers under
Linux and related that to some basic notions of frequency-domain analysis. The objective was to
generate square waves with the LabJack U3-LV USB data acquisition system (DAQ) and see their
spectrum in the frequency domain. You must accomplish the following tasks.

1. Practice: Write a C program for the Linux system on the host machine to read two floating
point voltages between 0 and +5 volts from the user. 
2. Practice: Compute and display the maximum frequency of the square wave that can be
generated with the system-wide realtime clock (CLOCK REALTIME). 
3. Practice: Read a floating point square wave frequency in Hz from the user. (10 points)
4. Practice: Use a timer, a SIGRTMIN handler function, and the LabJack U3-LV USB DAQ to
generate a digital square wave. 
5. Practice: Use a second timer, a SIGRTMAX handler function, and the LabJack U3-LV USB
DAQ to generate an analog square wave between the given voltages at the specified frequency.

6. Practice: Provide a user prompt to terminate the program and gracefully release the USB
device. 
7. Practice: Use the FFT function of your oscilloscope to compute the Fourier Transform of the
digital square wave generated by your program. Compare & contrast the FFT produced by
the scope with the theoretically generated one (step above) when the wave parameters are
comparable.
