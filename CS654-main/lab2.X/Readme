The purpose of this lab was to introduce interrupts and Timers on the dsPIC33F board. We wrote a program that does all of the following.
1. Toggle LED4 inside your main program loop on every iteration. 
2. Toggle LED1 every 5 millisecond using Timer2’s interrupt. 
3. Toggle LED2 every 1 second using Timer1’s interrupt.
4. In the main loop, display in a static location the time since the last reset on every 25000th
iteration. The format should be mm:ss.xxx where mm is minutes, ss is seconds, and xxx is
milliseconds. 
5. Reset the time to 00:00.000 when the joystick “fire” (button 1) is pressed using edge-triggered
external interrupt request 1 (not by polling the button). Read the documents and revise the
lecture slides about interrupts to see how to properly enable the interrupt. 
6. Use the 16-bit Timer3 to measure how long it takes to execute each iteration of the main
program loop. Display the time in a static location as both the TMR3 count value (cycles)
and in milliseconds to 4 decimal places.
