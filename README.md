Using the Microchip dsPIC Microcontroller (dsPIC33FJ256MC710) to work on programs on the Amazing Ball System .
The ABS (Amazing Ball System) is a system consisting of three main circuit boards in a stacked configuration: FLEX
Light Base Board, FLEX Demo2 Daughter Board, and a custom designed FLEX-UI board (which has an LCD module, LEDs, 12-bit DAC and 4 GPIO pins).
The core of the system is a dsPIC33f microcontroller running at 12.8Mhz. 
The selected dsPIC33 is a modified Harvard archiecture with 256 Kbytes on-chip Flash and 30 Kbytes of Data
SRAM. The dsPIC33 also has two Analog-to-Digital hardware modules (24 channels with either
10-bit or 12-bit resolution), nine 16-bit timers, and two UART modules.
